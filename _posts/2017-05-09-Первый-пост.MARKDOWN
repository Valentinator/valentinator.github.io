That is my first post. I decided to write in English instead of Russian. This is my first public website generated by jekyll software. It is written in Ruby, which I have no idea of. I installed it simply following general instractions of Codeacedemy webcourse called 'Deploy a website'. I didn't think that it is that tricky.
